# FAQ Block

Collect **F**requently **A**sked **Q**uestions in a custom post type with custom taxonomies and display them on any
page you like on your website with the **FAQ Block**.

## Create Posts

Create single FAQ posts in *FAQ Items* and define the question and content of your FAQ item.
You may also assign and create *Categories* for your either FAQ posts in the post type menu or
inside the single post directly.

## Insert

In order to add the block, click on the **Inserter** `+` icon. Search for the **FAQ** block and click on
it to add it to the post or page.

## Settings

After inserting an **FAQ** block, the block pulls the posts from all categories sorted by when they
were created (newest first). In the inspector menu, you may select any number of categories to be used
for filtering and may sort the FAQ posts either alphabetically or by the dates they were created on, ascending
or descending.
