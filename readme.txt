= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “Block Data Attribute”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [a detailed instruction on how to do this](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation "Manual plugin installation").

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
